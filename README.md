# Anton Andresen

Tech freelancer, entrepreneur & CTO building things that matter.

## What I Do

Currently co-founder & CTO at **[oriiion.ai](https://oriiion.ai)** — a VC-backed startup ($5M valuation) building the future of AI-powered marketing.

I help companies ship products, scale tech teams, and turn ideas into reality. Available for select consulting & advisory work.

## Tech

Building with modern stacks — whatever solves the problem best. Heavy on **Vue/Nuxt** and **Convex** lately.

Focused on:
- AI/ML applications
- Full-stack development
- System architecture & scalability
- Product-driven engineering

## Building

Side projects and experiments:
- **[nuxt-pogton-starter](https://github.com/antonandresen/nuxt-pogton-starter)** — production-ready Nuxt 4 starter with shadcn-vue, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Built for shipping SaaS projects fast.
- **[pogscript](https://github.com/antonandresen/pogscript)** — a programming language
- **the more** — [description coming soon]

## Connect

Open to interesting projects and conversations.
